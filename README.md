Lab 2: Doubly-Linked Lists

Lab 2
Doubly-Linked List
Description
Write a Doubly-Linked List ADT that includes the methods listed below.

Linked-List Class Methods
* Canonical Methods
* Mutators/Accessors
* isEmpty – does the list have any elements in it?
* First – return a const reference to the data in the first element.
* Last – return a const reference to the data in the last element.
* Prepend – add an item to the front of the list.
* Append – add an item to the end of the list.
* Purge – remove all items from the list.
* Extract – remove a single item from the list.
* InsertAfter – insert an item after an item in the list. 
* InsertAfter(new_item, existing_item);
* InsertBefore – insert an item before an item in the list. 
* InsertBefore(new_item, existing_item);
* getHead – return the head pointer (TESTING ONLY)
* getTail – return the tail pointer (TESTING ONLY)
PrintForwards – print the list forwards (TESTING ONLY)

PrintBackwards – print the list backwards (TESTING ONLY)


Linked-List Class Data Members

Head pointer

Tail pointer

Node Class Methods

Canonical Methods

Mutators/Accessors
Node Class Data Members
Data (type T)
Next pointer
Previous pointer


Stipulations
1. Make a friendship relationship between Node and List.
2. Write your own test functions. 
3. Do not use the sentinel method.
4. Use your Exception class to throw appropriate errors.


Deliverables
One file including:
* Your code
* Your test(s) and their results
* The results of Lab2_test.cpp
